# Virtual Salesman
The purpose of the project is to develop a system that takes as input videos of various hand movements, extracts landmark information from them and defines the type of gesture made with this information. Furhat Robot(Virtual Agent) reacts according to the gesture provided in the input video.

# Objective


# Requirements
 It requires Furhat SDK(JDK-8), IntelliJ IDEA, Kotlin programming language  as a domain-specific-language (DSL) and some default libraries.

Our virtual robot acts as a virtual salesman and provides all the information about the Zapple mobile phone based on the detected gesture. Every gesture has a unique response from the robot.
